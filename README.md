# Assembly Language Examples 

**This repository contains files that have example assembly code written in them that execute simple operations. These programs can be executed in LC-3 (Little Compter 3) which is a simulator that simulates the CPU**

## Getting Started 

**ex1.asm:** This program subtracts the number in the variable SECOND from the number in the variable FIRST and stores the result in the variable DIFF

**ex2.asm:** This program computes the sum of 5 numbers in the array named LIST and stores this sum in the variable named SUM

**ex3.asm:** This program multiplies the numbers in the variables FIRST and SECOND and stores the result in the variable PRODUCT

**ex4.asm:** This program manipulates the numbers in the two variables SMALLER and LARGER until the number in SMALLER is smaller than the number in LARGER

**strings.asm:** This program prompts user for their name and outputs the name as it is input as well as in uppercase letters 

**factorial.asm:** This program computes the factorial of a number and then divides the number by 5 to obtain the quotient and the remainder
